Project Name: Express Currency Converter

Description: This application of mine will allow users to be able to convert 50 major currencies from at least 70 countries across the globe to their preferred choices of output. It will take a base currency (USD) and convert immediately upon the user's input and selection of the currency that he/she wants converted.

Users will also be able to toggle between any two currencies when they are using the application and this will allow them to know in an instance how much they are looking to get back when they return from their trips. Exchange rates data are updated at least once every 24 hours with data collected from a number of central banks across the world. Last but not least, this converter also uses the standard abbreviations for all the currencies making it super user-friendly for users!
