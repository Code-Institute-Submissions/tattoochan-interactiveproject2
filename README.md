Project Name: Express Currency Converter

Description: This application of mine will allow users to be able to convert 50 major currencies from at least 70 countries across the globe to their preferred choices of output. It will take a base currency (USD) and convert immediately upon the user's input and selection of the currency that he/she wants converted. The users will also be able to view live exchange rates of the 7 currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, RMB, INR & SGD) even before they do any conversion. They will be able to view first of one unit of the selected currency of the afore-mentioned currencies.  

Users will also be able to toggle between any two currencies when they are using the application and this will allow them to know in an instance how much they are looking to get back when they return from their trips. Exchange rates data are updated at least once every 24 hours with data collected from a number of central banks across the world. Last but not least, this converter also uses the standard abbreviations for all the currencies making it super user-friendly for users!

To explain how the currency converter works, when a user visits the site, he or she will need to first select the currency to be converted (A). Thereafter, the user will will have to select the currency that he or she wants to be converted into(B). Finally the user will have to input the amount (a number up to 2 decimal places) before clicking convert to get the converted amount.

The user can also toggle between (A) and (B) to switch between the currencies to find out the converted rates.
